# Kinich

This is a neural Network framework written by C++11.

The key idea of Kinich is to accelerate the neural 
network computing by using concurrency strategy. It 
could be used in the limited computational resources
and low latency applicatoins. It would include many 
feature in the future:

1. Graph computing

2. Threading pool

3. Hardward Specialization
